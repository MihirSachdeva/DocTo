# DocTo


A digital-medical-prescription management app, where doctors can upload medical prescriptions for different patients.

Maintaining prescriptions and medical history has always been a pain when you have a lot of family members. 

The prescriptions are grouped based on the patient they belong to. As a future project, I look forward to integrating the app with a functioning Login page for different doctors and family members, and again grouping the prescriptions for a patient based on the doctor who prescribed them. Also, a feature to add new family members can also be a future endevour :) 

To run the app, simply head over to pure-ravine-95430.herokuapp.com

OR

Run

npm i

In the terminal to install all dependencies. Then Type

localhost:4444

in your browser to run the app locally.

Hope you like it! :)
